# Amethyst

Amethyst is a dark-purple Minecraft launcher built with Node.js and a
**polished zero-build web UI**. The launcher runs locally, serves plain HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript, and requires no frontend framework, bundler, native UI
toolchain, or extra runtime.

> **Legal/download note:** Amethyst does not include or redistribute Minecraft
> client code, libraries, assets, or copyrighted game files. When you install or
> launch a version, it reads Mojang's public version manifest and downloads the
> official files from Mojang/Microsoft-hosted URLs on the user's machine.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Node.js 18 or newer.
- Java 17 or newer to launch Minecraft. Amethyst detects installed Java and can
  manage Java runtimes through the UI.
- Internet access for first-time downloads, news, loader metadata, and optional
  Microsoft login.

```bash
npm start
```

Amethyst binds to `127.0.0.1` on an available port and opens the launcher in
your browser. If it does not open automatically, use the URL printed in the
terminal.

Useful environment variables:

```bash
AMETHYST_HOME=/path/to/data npm start   # store data somewhere else
AMETHYST_NO_OPEN=1 npm start            # do not open a browser automatically
PORT=8080 npm start                     # use a fixed local port
AMETHYST_MS_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-app-id npm start  # optional OAuth client
```

The web UI is intentionally just the files in `public/`: it starts quickly,
works anywhere Node.js runs, and can be customized without a build step.

## UI

The browser UI is designed to feel like a polished desktop launcher while
keeping the implementation simple:

- Responsive glassy dark-purple interface with inline SVG iconography.
- Overview dashboard with quick launch, runtime status, recent activity, news,
  and file shortcuts.
- Instance browser with isolated profiles and per-instance settings.
- Searchable official release and snapshot browser.
- Offline and Microsoft account profiles.
- Java detection and managed Java downloads.
- Live download queue, speed, ETA, install, launch, and log feedback.
- Keyboard navigation (`1`–`4`) and mobile navigation.

To change the look, edit `public/index.html` and `public/styles.css`. To change
behavior, edit `public/app.js`; the Node server automatically serves those
files. No build command is needed.

### Official Minecraft files

metadata, including the client jar, libraries, native libraries, asset index,
and asset objects. It does not grant a Minecraft license; users must comply
with Minecraft's EULA and applicable terms.

## Development checks

```bash
npm test
```

## MVP limitations

- Microsoft authentication requires a configured Azure application client ID
  when the default client is unavailable.
- Offline accounts cannot join servers that require authenticated Microsoft
  sessions.
- The launcher downloads official files but does not include or redistribute
  Minecraft code or assets.
